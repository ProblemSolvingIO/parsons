======================
Parsons programming puzzles are a type of scaffolded program
construction tasks where the learner is given a set of code fragments,
blocks of a single or multiple lines of code,
and the task is to piece together a program from these.
Learners not only select and order but also indent code fragments.

They are challenging problems that reduces the cognitive load
and time spent for students.

This variant of Parsons programming puzzles is called two-dimensional (2D) Parsons problems.
In Python, code indentation has a semantic meaning, as an indented statement falls into
the surrounding control structure, which has lower indentation.
That is, code blocks are deﬁned by indentation instead of start and end symbols like curly braces.

The use of Parsons puzzles is an evidence-based teaching practice.
